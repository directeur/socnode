This is an implementation of socnodes (http://socnode.org) in django using the
app-engine patch.
This is currently a proof of concept, so your contribution is verry welcome!

Requirements:
=============
This django app is destined to be run on google appengine platform hence it
requires from you a google app engine, which you can get freely here:
http://appengine.google.com

This app is built thanks to the port of django called app-engine-patch.
You should download it here: http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/

Installation:
=============

1) download app-engine-patch and unzip everything to a directory
2) Get a Google App Engine account at http://appengine.google.com
3) Create a new application.  Note your application identifier.
4) Edit the included app.yaml.sample:
    i) Change the text APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER to the application identifier
    created in step 2.
    ii) Rename it to app.yaml
5) Edit templates/base.html to make it your own (optional).
5) Copy everyhting you grab here to the directory created in (1)
6) Deploy by running:
